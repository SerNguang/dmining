Bartley Ridge sits almost on top of Bartley MRT Station on the Circle Line, so it could not be more convenient. This means residents of Bartley Ridge can be in Orchard or the CBD in 25 minutes, door to door. As well as the MRT, there is a bus stop right outside the development which is served by several routes, with many more stopping outside Tai Seng MRT, 1 stop or a short walk away.For those preferring to drive, they are also in luck with the CTE, KPE, PIE and the Bartley-Tampines Viaduct giving quick and easy access from Bartley Ridge to every part of the island.

Sky Habitat – Unique Selling Points

Sky Habitat is a stunningly designed building (the same architect that was behind Marina Bay Sands), and it has a very good array of facilities, high-quality units, appliances and fixtures and fittings, but it is its location where it comes into its own. Located in Bishan on the city fringes, Sky Habitat is a 3-minute walk from Bishan MRT on the North South and Circle Lines. That means you can be in the CBD in a little over 20 minutes, door to door. Junction 8 with its retail and dining options and cinema is also a 3-minute walk from the development, while Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park is a short distance away providing residents of Sky Habitat some respite from the buzz of the city.

Sky Habitat – Accessibility

In terms of accessibility, Sky Habitat is hard to beat. Bishan MRT Station on the North South and Circle Lines is a 3-minute walk from the development. From there it is 8 stops to Raffles Place, and Orchard will take about 10 minutes. Bishan is also the location for the bus interchange, giving access to those parts of the island not covered by the MRT network. Junction 8 with more than 170 shops, plus a cinema is a 3-minute walk from Sky Habitat.

In terms of driving, major arterial roads such as Braddell Road, Upper Thomson Road and Marymount Road are all within easy reach, as are the PIE and CTE. This means in good conditions, it is just a 10-minute drive to Orchard Road, and only very slightly longer to the CBD.

3 bedder unit for rent
                                    3 BEDDER unit for rent Gem Residences is located in the Toa Payoh Town region. It is situated in the Toa Payoh town place that’s located right next to Braddell MRT and Toa Payoh MRT Station. Owners will rejoice as it is near to both MRT Stations with many HDB shophouses which supply retail shops for the residents.
Analysts see that this project will probably be well received even after the developer has started Gem Residences, since it has been a long time there’s a fresh start in the area. Once the first batch of buyers decide to sell their unit in other words, there’ll be resale demand.
Central Expressway (CTE) as well as Pan Island Expressway is, in addition, a short distance away from the development. So, time doesn’t have to be squandered when traveling home during the little roads back home.

For family that are searching for great schools to send their children to, there are various established institutions around the Toa Payoh area. For instance, Pei Chin Public School together with CHIJ Primary and Secondary School just some of the great schools that’s a short walk away from Gem Residences Braddell by Evia Real Estate. Also, Beatty Secondary School is also a good secondary school to contemplating their previous history to get.

                                    Gem Residences is the newest development by Evia Real Estate which is located in the Toa Payoh Town region. It is situated in the Toa Payoh town place that’s located right next to Braddell MRT and Toa Payoh MRT Station. Owners will rejoice as it is near to both MRT Stations with many HDB shophouses which supply retail shops for the residents.

Analysts see that this project will probably be well received even after the developer has started Gem Residences, since it has been a long time there’s a fresh start in the area. Once the first batch of buyers decide to sell their unit in other words, there’ll be resale demand.

Central Expressway (CTE) as well as Pan Island Expressway is, in addition, a short distance away from the development. So, time doesn’t have to be squandered when traveling home during the little roads back home. Coming soon at River Valley is the upcoming new launch, the RV Altitude Roxy beside 2 RV condo.

For instance, Pei Chin Public School together with CHIJ Primary and Secondary School just some of the great schools that’s a short walk away from Gem Residences Braddell by Evia Real Estate. Also, Beatty Secondary School is also a good secondary school to contemplating their previous history to get.

For Gem Residences owners that are taking public transport, the development is close to Braddell MRT station and is only a quick walk away.

For owners of Gem Residences Toa Payoh, initial strategies by the developer reveals that it’ll be a full condominium facilities development with many of the facilities located in large developments accessible at Gem Residences Evia Real Estate. As there will be a tennis court available for the residents to use, participate a tennis coach for the children is currently available.

Set over 2 blocks, both of 44 storeys, Queens Park has 736 well designed units with functional, smart layouts. Units start on the 8th floor and go all the way to the 44th, where the 4 large penthouse suites are located. Queens Park boasts several features that are unusual for a development in this price range, including private lifts and foyers for many of the units, not just the penthouses. Location-wise, Queens Park couldn’t be more convenient for the MRT, as it overlooks the Queenstown Station, and a bridge is being planned to connect the station to the development.

Units start on the 8th floor and go all the way to the 44th, where the 4 large penthouse suites are located. Queens Park boasts several features that are unusual for a development in this price range, including private lifts and foyers for many of the units, not just the penthouses.

Although the development is located within a tranquil residential enclave, supermarket like NTUC FairPrice and Great World Shopping Centre are within walking distance. There are also plenty of shophouse eateries along Killiney Road. 8 Saint Thomas is especially suitable for the urbanites who enjoy the vibe of modern city living as the development is close to Somerset and Orchard, where most luxury fashion brands and fine dining options are located. For parents-to-be, there are plenty top-notch educational institutions for consideration. These include River Valley Primary School, St. Margaret’s Primary School and Anglo-Chinese School

​Sims Urban Oasis is developed by GuocoLand Limited (GuocoLand), who along with its subsidiaries, are primarily involved in property development, property investment, hotel operations and property management. The Group has established property operations in their geographical markets of Singapore, China, Malaysia and Vietnam, comprising residential, hospitality, commercial and retail developments.

Sims Urban Oasis – Unique Selling Points

Sims Urban Oasis is certainly a luxury residential development. Because it sits on formerly HDB owned land there are no other condominiums in the surrounding area. It is on the fringes of the city, in an area that is destined to have major developments in the coming years. Aljunied MRT Station is only a short walk from the development, from where it is just 5 stops to Raffles Place. There are two hawker centres very close by, as well as a good choice of eateries a few minutes’ walk from the development. As well as a large range of residential units, Sims Urban Oasis also features 7 shops and a childcare centre.

Sims Urban Oasis – Accessibility

The nearest MRT to Sims Urban Oasis is Aljunied on the East West Line, which is a short walk away. Paya Lebar MRT is then 1 stop away where you can connect to the Circle Line. Going the other direction, Kallang Interchange is 1 stop down the line, with City Hall and Raffles Place 3 and 4 more stops respectively. The PIE runs just behind Sims Urban Oasis, giving residents very quick access to that and other areas of the island.

** About Queens Peak **

Located opposite Queenstown MRT, Queens Peak is located along Dundee Road, in the mature Queenstown satellite town. Queens Peak, which will be launched soon, has 736 luxurious units, comprising 2 tower blocks and ranging from 1 to 5 bedroom sizes and large single level penthouse units with private pools.

Its design is driven by organic architecture where harmony is promoted between the abode and the natural environment. For example, at each alternate level, the gardens extend from the respective lift lobby, serving as communal sky gardens. They also serve as a social space to foster communal living in the sky. Residents will enjoy facilities at the ground level, 7th storey as well as 27th storey sky gardens. Within the curvilinear façade lies rectilinear spaces to ensure excellent space planning.

Queens Peak is a direct link on the East West train to Changi Airport as well as the Future High Speed Rail to Malaysia. This suits the lifestyle of the well-heeled who crave inner city living. Queens Peak embodies the confluence of style and smart location. The locale is a zip to the CBD and the premier Orchard Road shopping belt, Great World City and Dempsey Hill. Interesting hawker centres and quaint outlets are found in its neighbourhood such as Mei Ling Street, Alexandra Village Food Centre, and ABC Brickworks Market and the hip Tiong Bahru and Holland Village precincts.

MCC is project managing it for developer HY Realty (Dundee) Pte Ltd.

Fire Sale! Rare Dual-Key Unit Near Canberra MRT Station
                                    Dual-key unit with a 2-bedroom unit on one side and a studio unit (with kitchenette) on the other side

Free shuttle bus to Yishun MRT station and Chong Pang market.

High floor unit with a spectacular view of the pools!

Nestling in the tranquility of Sembawang, One Canberra combines a modern minimalist style amidst the freedom of wide open spaces.

Immerse yourself in the 50 metre free-form pool, family pool, beach splash pool or wading pool that smack right in the heart of the residences and nearing a host of amenities such as dining and wine pods, pool cabanas, jacuzzi, hydro spas, water lounges, children's playground, tennis court and BBQ area - all these ensconced amidst the vast tropical landscape, just like an alluring paradise.

Embark on a fascinating sojourn into urban heartlands and nature sites as you venture along the meandering 25km park connector loop. As you pedal on a bicycle or take a leisurely drive, you will experience the laidback, yet scenic neighbouring communities. Flora and fauna habitats are in abundance and One Canberra is at the heart of it all.

Advantages of a dual-key unit
- ideal for multi-generation families who want to live under the same roof but at the same time maintain their own privacy
- ideal for owners who wish to enjoy rental income without owning a second property. Owners can stay in and rent out a part of their property at the same time without compromising on privacy
- renting out a sub-unit typically fetches higher a higher psf rental than a standalone unit
- own 2 units of properties without paying ABSD (Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty)

One of the most Relaxing Condo in singapore 
Located at the Heart of Singapore 
Yet we are away from the busy district 

Corals at Keppel Bay is like a resort at home 
MRT connectivity is well-taken care of too!  
Harbourfront MRT Station 500 meters (6mins walk) 
With VivoCity and HarbourFront Centre being a stone’s throw away

A unique and rare waterfront living experience
In Singapore if you are looking for a property which offers you an unobstructed sea view and without facing an expressway, there are only 2 well-known places – Sentosa and Keppel Bay.

If you are looking into the FUTURE, 
The Keppel Bay precinct will be part of the Greater Southern Waterfront, a massive 2,000-hectare land area which spans across the southern coastline of Singapore – from Pasir Panjang all the way to Gardens by the Bay.

One of the major plans in this project is the redevelopment plan for the existing Keppel Club site (which is next to the Keppel Bay collection of condos). It will be used for more housing projects when its lease ends in 2021.

Corals at Keppel Bay epitomizes luxuriance and class. It’s like living in a work of art. 
An Olympic-size swimming pool, a separate lounger pool and another splash pool with jumping jets for the usage and enjoyment of residents. A lovely hydro spa promises further leisure and relaxation.

A tennis court and children’s play area is for the benefit of the sporty individuals. 
The clubhouse at Corals at Keppel Bay is also enticing with its multipurpose studio, lounge room, function room, and fully-equipped gymnasium.

On top of that, a BBQ party pavilion is also being added to allow residents to host events and mingle with their neighbors.

Contact me now for vitural tour on Corals at Keppel bay!

Uniquely designed, brand new exclusive unit
                                    A cozy apartment designed with Japanese aesthetics in mind, featuring a platform of tatami mats custom-made and imported from Japan. This platform overlooks a Japanese garden with a water feature, providing the perfect place to unwind and relax. It also provides storage for less-used items, thereby fully utilising the space in the apartment. Ample storage line the walls, hidden behind warm wood-grained doors that provide a seamless line of sight to the garden and tatami mats. This unit is functional but does not skimp on creating a Japanese oasis amidst urban living. As you return everyday, the fresh smell of tatami and sound of running water will greet you and wash away the fatigue of the day.

The property is linked directly to the park connector and provides yet another way to connect with nature. For those who wish to stay within the comforts of the condominium, the expansive pool awaits you with its jacuzzi, hydro-bicycles, and a long soak. 

Rather than visiting Japan only once or twice a year, you have the chance to make Japan part of your home with this apartment.

​Sims Urban Oasis is developed by GuocoLand Limited (GuocoLand), who along with its subsidiaries, are primarily involved in property development, property investment, hotel operations and property management. The Group has established property operations in their geographical markets of Singapore, China, Malaysia and Vietnam, comprising residential, hospitality, commercial and retail developments.

Sims Urban Oasis – Unique Selling Points

Sims Urban Oasis is certainly a luxury residential development. Because it sits on formerly HDB owned land there are no other condominiums in the surrounding area. It is on the fringes of the city, in an area that is destined to have major developments in the coming years. Aljunied MRT Station is only a short walk from the development, from where it is just 5 stops to Raffles Place. There are two hawker centres very close by, as well as a good choice of eateries a few minutes’ walk from the development. As well as a large range of residential units, Sims Urban Oasis also features 7 shops and a childcare centre.

Sims Urban Oasis – Accessibility

The nearest MRT to Sims Urban Oasis is Aljunied on the East West Line, which is a short walk away. Paya Lebar MRT is then 1 stop away where you can connect to the Circle Line. Going the other direction, Kallang Interchange is 1 stop down the line, with City Hall and Raffles Place 3 and 4 more stops respectively. The PIE runs just behind Sims Urban Oasis, giving residents very quick access to that and other areas of the island.

Be enchanted! Look for the Virtual Tour in the page.
Parc Esta is the newest condominium to be launched in Eunos. Directly opposite Eunos MRT, Parc Esta has been one of the best launch in 2018. As of Nov, 87% out of 1399 units have been sold. Don't miss out as no new launches near MRT is selling at $15xx psf already.

Why?
Reason A: Location Location
1) Parc Esta is located just across the Eunos MRT line. And only 5 stations to Bugis station or 7 stations to Raffles Place. Such location will typically attract tenants and home owners. Hence, the demand from both investors and home owners is proven.
2) located just minutes walk from food center and amenities
3) Parc Esta is a gateway to PIE, Katong and City 

Reason B: In the heart of Transformation Growth
1) Buy now and reap the potential capital growth. The Government has earmarked  Paya Lebar as one of the future growth areas.  This all means more jobs and then more demand for rental. 
2) Paya Lebar Central will be a bustling, integrated commercial node with offices, retail and attractive public spaces flowing with activity. The distinctive local identity will be enhanced with the Wisma Geylang Serai and a new pedestrian mall and plaza space along Geylang Road.

Reason C: Quality Developer
1) You are buying from MCL land who is known for building quality homes. The architect is the award winning P&T Consultants. The Landscape Consultant is Ecoplan Asia Pte Ltd.
