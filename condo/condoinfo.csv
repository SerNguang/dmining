With Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Batok Town Park, Little Guilin, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Hillside Park all on the project’s doorstep, there aren’t many new developments with such green surroundings on the island.

Hills TwoOne also offers the relatively rare option of 2 and 3 bed penthouses.Macly RL Pte Ltd – the developer for Hills TwoOne - are a Singapore-based developer with a strong track record of developing high quality and affordable properties throughout the island.

Hills TwoOne is rare in offering 2 and 3 bed penthouses, and the fact it is a freehold property also gives it additional value. The main advantage Hills TwoOne has in its favour however, is its proximity to some wonderful countryside. Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Batok Town Park and Little Guilin are all a stone’s throw from the development, while Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Hillside Park are not much further away.Hills TwoOne – AccessibilityHills TwoOne is located roughly equidistant between 3 MRT stations, namely Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak stations (both on the North South Line) and Hillview near Downtown Line.
