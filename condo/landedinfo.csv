It was designed by a Japanese architect and included artificial hills and man-made lakes, as well as a Japanese teashop to add to the quiet splendor of the garden. It was likened to The Gardens by the Bay of its time just that the government had no say in building it. The Gardens would only see a brief period of fame as it would disappear with the fortunes of the Alkaffs. The Alkaffs did badly after the Japanese conquered because they were seen as too chummy with the Americans and British and therefore dangerous. Trade declined, as did real estate. The Gardens did fine though, the Japanese liked it and kept it intact. But with the poor economic situation after the war, the Garden became seen not as a public good but a luxury vanity project that was draining much need funds from other places. The Alkaffs were never to be the influential family they once were. The Garden was sold to the Sennett Realty Company in 1949 and was converted into residential property known as the Sennett Estate. Today, Sennett Estate is a quiet, laid back middle class private residential estate surrounded by public housing estates (Potong Pasir and Macpherson).Project Name: Sennett EstateType: Semi -Detached Housing EstateDistrict: 12Unit Types:4- bedroom 2-bathroom (1350 square feet, S$2.4 million)5- bedroom 3-bathroom (1500 square feet, S$2.7 million)6- bedroom 7-bathroom (3417 square feet, S$5.9 million)5- bedroom 6-bathroom (1819 square feet, S$3.9 million)4- bedroom 5-bathroom (2425 square feet, S$4.2 million)Sennett Estate – Nearby ProjectsThe following are similar listings that are worth checking outThe ArteThe Marque at IrrawandyTrevistaDomusVista Residences"
