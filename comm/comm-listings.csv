ABOUT THE LOCATION
The rejuvenation of the Yishun town centre can be easily summed with one integrated development – Northpoint City. Comprising an integrated transport hub that incorporates an air-conditioned bus interchange, a direct shopping underpass to Yishun MRT station, a retail city with 500 shops and the first community club based in a retail mall, a town plaza, a town garden and a residential development, integration is at best a lackluster word, as we can basically enjoy every modern convenience one can think of, all under one roof.

TRANSPORT
It will also be faster and easier travelling downtown or to other regions of Singapore with the new Springleaf MRT station along the upcoming Thomson East Coast Line and the building of new roads, from future Yishun Avenue 8 to improved Yishun Avenue 1, which connects to Seletar West Link as an alternative route to CTE, TPE and SLE. At the same time, the junction of Lentor Avenue and Yishun Avenue 1 will be improved to enable smoother traffic flow.

Listed rented price: $12,500 is without T&C. But attractive rental  price of $10,500 is subjected to T&C only. 

If any F&B entrepreneur is of bringing the foreign food concepts into Yishun, do drop me a PM to begin connecting for viewing appointments

Stunning Development; Rare Opportunity
PS100 is a stylish SOHO development located in the heart of the bustling Central Business District, Tanjong Pagar. This strata titled development – which is rare and limited in the vicinity – is integrated with hotel, Oasia Downtown, offering owners or tenants access to professional concierge services. This one of its kind development also features sleek and compact living and working space that offers a chic alternative to the traditional office space.

While the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station is just at its doorstep, world class business and entertainment hubs such as Marina Bay Downtown, Orchard Road and Sentosa are just a short drive away. Designated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) as the next waterfront city in Singapore, Tanjong Pagar is on track to become a vibrant business, commercial and residential hub as the area expects a burgeoning of mixed-use developments in the near future.

Whole New Work-Play Integrated Experience
To provide to a more enjoyable working environment, common amenities in the development include business pods as well as recreational amenities and the roof sky bar that offers views of the city skyline.

High ceiling of 5m with the provision of platforms.

Often known as the second CBD, the boring sister to the more glamorous Raffles Place and Marina Bay, it gained this reputation because of its’ older office buildings housing smaller companies and government bodies.

In recent years, that impression has changed. New skyscrapers, award-wining hawkers and trendy restaurants began to positively shift its reputation. 

In fact, Raffles Place and Marina Bay might want to watch their backs because Tanjong Pagar will soon undergo a transformation that may turn her into the belle of the ball.

Tanjong Pagar is truly a place where one can work, eat and live.

Today, Tanjong Pager is home to all kinds of businesses from government bodies and MNCs in tall office towers to tiny start-ups in one of the many restored shophouses. Tanjong Pagar can even boast of having the tallest building in Singapore. At 290m tall, Guoco Tower beats the record of 280m, long held by UOB Plaza, One Raffles Place and Republic Plaza!

There is no lack of good food in Tanjong Pagar. The hordes of hungry office workers during lunch time at Maxwell Market and Amoy Street Food Centre is proof that both places dish up affordable and delicious food. In fact, Maxwell Market and Amoy Street Food Centre together account for six of the Top 50 Bib Gourmand eateries for 2018.

Residents of Tanjong Pagar are certainly living the high life. At 50 storeys high, the seven residential towers in Pinnacle@Duxton are collectively the world’s tallest public housing. 

Travelling from Tanjong Pagar to the rest of the island is a breeze. Just hop onto the East-West Line at Tanjong Pagar MRT station and in less than five minutes arrive at Raffles Place MRT station and  change trains to get on the N-S Line

TESTIMONIALS:

I was impressed with Janet's knowledge of the areas, information provided and opportunities existed to achieve our aspirations for our new regional Hub facilities. I was very impressed with her capability to respond at virtually any time of the day & night, including weekends, which was a real advantage given that London are operating 7-8 hours behind Singapore. The experience of working with Janet has been excellent and thank you for going the 'extra mile'.
- Jonathan Hill (Chairman of Scott Brownrigg)

Janet is a highly efficient and resourceful commercial agent. She listened to our needs and requirements thoughtfully and helped our company find ideal office within 2 viewings. We are grateful that we had a honest & down-to-earth agent helping us.

Located at the Heart of Chinatown
                                    Most sought after corner unit within Chinatown area that is located on the Main Street with good frontage and human traffic!

If you don’t mind delving into some of the more touristy parts of Singapore, Chinatown is a section of the city more than worth stopping by at. We were lucky enough to speak with the Chinatown Business Association who discussed with us what makes Chinatown a must visit area in Singapore:

“Chinatown Singapore is strategically located in the central area of Singapore which makes it easily accessible to/from other parts of Singapore. Encompassed by rows of post-war historical shophouses, visitors get to explore Singapore’s oldest Hindu and Muslim worshipping places – Sri Mariamman Temple and Masjid Jamae Mosque – and learn about Buddhism at the four-storey Buddha Tooth Relic Temple all in Chinatown Singapore. The only Chinatown in South East Asia that houses three different religions’ places of worship, this emphasizes our core values of a multi-racial society.

“Shop at Chinatown Street Market where it re-creates the street hawking scene of yesteryear with a wide array of Singapore-centric and themed souvenirs, apparels, and Chinese arts and crafts items. Visitors can stop by Chinatown Visitor Centre to get more information about Singapore and Chinatown, as well as purchase discounted attractions tickets and souvenirs that reflect the true Chinese cultural aspects of Chinatown all in the same place. The must visit Chinatown Heritage Centre is the only place in Singapore that has recreated the original interiors and living conditions of its shophouse tenants in the 1950s.

If you are a company or an entrepreneur who is just starting out, this bright, spacious 142 sq. ft cluster of fully furnished work stations (with windows!) is perfect for up to 4 people and has an unblocked view of SingPost Centre. 

In the new post CoVid era, we will all be looking for smaller, more flexible work spaces with tenancies which do not tie us down for too long. We would also be looking to conserve cost on renovations, equipment and occupying a space larger than what we really need. And we would want to be in a newly renovated and fully equipped office with WiFi,  a meeting room, a printer and pantry we can use at a great address.

Cluster of 3 work stations (120, sq. ft, windowless) is also available at S$1400 / month NEG. In fact if you are looking for just a seat or two, we are happy to consider that too!

PLS, together with Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ) and SingPost Centre, make up the heart of the Paya Lebar business district. With the Paya Lebar MRT interchange (East West & Circle Lines) station at your door step, accessibility to the rest of Singapore is a breeze.

This beautifully renovated and fully furnished Executive Room has floor to ceiling windows with wonderful views of the SingPost Centre and the open field next to it. Bright and modern, it is fully furnished to a very high standard. The room is secure with access only to yourself. You will also be able to conduct your meetings at the office's conference room.

If you have other colleagues, don't worry. There are up to 7 independent workspaces just outside of the Executive Room which are also available for lease. Just let us know what you need and we will be more than happy to see what we can do for you.

In this post CoVid era, what is important is the ability to be agile and to not be over burdened by the high costs of setting up an office and rigid long term tenancies for a space which may be more than what we need. We would want a fully equipped office space that we can move right into with just our laptops complete with WiFi, a conference room, a printer and pantry we can use, at a great address.

                                    Ideal for F&B restaurant or various uniquely food court 

ABOUT THE LOCATION
The rejuvenation of the Yishun town centre can be easily summed with one integrated development – Northpoint City. Comprising an integrated transport hub that incorporates an air-conditioned bus interchange, a direct shopping underpass to Yishun MRT station, a retail city with 500 shops and the first community club based in a retail mall, a town plaza, a town garden and a residential development, integration is at best a lackluster word, as we can basically enjoy every modern convenience one can think of, all under one roof.

TRANSPORT
It will also be faster and easier travelling downtown or to other regions of Singapore with the new Springleaf MRT station along the upcoming Thomson East Coast Line and the building of new roads, from future Yishun Avenue 8 to improved Yishun Avenue 1, which connects to Seletar West Link as an alternative route to CTE, TPE and SLE. At the same time, the junction of Lentor Avenue and Yishun Avenue 1 will be improved to enable smoother traffic flow.

Listed rented price: $12,500 is without T&C. But attractive rental  price of $10,500 is subjected to T&C only. 

If any F&B entrepreneur is of bringing the foreign food concepts into Yishun, do drop me a PM to begin connecting for viewing appointments

Robinson Road Available units  Nicely Fitted condition
                                    Robinson Road was perhaps built between 1882-1884 and could have opened for the public a few years later. 

 Sited along the road are fine examples of architecture built in the 1920s and 1930s including the former curved Telecoms Building which was previously known as the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company (1927), and later Cable and Wireless Building serving as the companys headquarters.  The Telecoms Building was known as Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS) Building before becoming The Ogilvy Centre today.    Another revival in the area is the Lau Pa Sat (formerly the Telok Ayer Market), which is a fully restored and preserved monument and was renamed so in 1989.

David has been most patient, understanding and helpful in ensuring that our office requirements are met despite stiff negotiations between the travelling landlords and agents. He kept a calm demeanour and stayed professional throughout, giving helpful suggestions and recommendations until an amicable and successful outcome was subsequently settled. We highly recommend David to anyone requiring his assistance in commercial office needs and wish him success and the very best for his career!”
-Ms Anna Tiau (Office Manager/HR Support of Grapeshot Asia Pacific Pte Ltd)

“Huge thanks to David for his help in locating a dream office for us. His professionalism and urgency has left a lasting positive impression.”
- Gabriel Loo (Managing director of Aspire Integrated Solutions Pte Ltd)

                                    Kallang MRT station (EW10) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station 
on the East West Line in Kallang, Singapore. Located next to the Kallang River, 
this used to be the nearest MRT station to the National Stadium until Stadium MRT station opened. 
Today, a sheltered walkway links Kallang station with the new Singapore Sports Hub.

Kallang station is the last above-ground station on the eastern section of the 
East West Line for trains travelling westwards. It is within close proximity to Geylang Bahru MRT Station on the Downtown Line.


On 8 November 1985, Lee Kim Tah was awarded the MRT civil contract for 
Kallang, Aljunied and Paya Lebar stations under Contract 302 and 303, including the viaducts from Kallang portal to Paya Lebar MRT station.[1]

On 28 December 2005, a 32-year-old Indian man died within minutes 
after he fell onto the tracks and was subsequently hit by 
an oncoming west-bound train. The incident occurred at about 3 pm and disrupted train services heading towards Boon Lay for 50 minutes. 4000 passengers had their trips disrupted. The man is believed to have jumped to his death.[2]

On 14 October 2011, some 6,500 commuters were 
affected by a train delay along the East West Line on Friday evening. An SMRT spokesperson said a westbound train at Kallang encountered a train fault and had to be taken out of service at 5.50 pm. Westbound train service between Kallang and Bugis were disrupted for 20 minutes. Trains were turned around at Bugis and Eunos.[3]

Geylang is a planning area and township located on the eastern fringe of the Central Region of Singapore, bordering Hougang and Toa Payoh in the north, Marine Parade in the south, Bedok in the east, and Kallang in the west.


Geylang is known perhaps most infamously as a red-light district, particularly the areas along Geylang Road. Geylang is also where one of Singapore's oldest Malay settlements, Geylang Serai, is.[4]

                                    Aljunied is a sub-urban area located in the central part of the city-state of Singapore. 
Named after Aljunied Road, it was formerly agricultural land which has since been heavily urbanised and presently comprises a variety of land uses. 
Today, Aljunied is a bustling neighbourhood with HDB flats with amenities like shops, schools, parks and recreational facilities.

Aljunied Road was officially named in 1926 after Syed Sharif Omar bin Ali Al Junied (died 1852), who owned large tracts of agricultural land in the area.

Syed Sharif Omar bin Ali Al Junied was a wealthy Hadhrami Arab merchant from Palembang, where he had set up business after migrating from his 
hometown in Tarim, Yemen.[1] He was also a highly respected man, looked upon by the Malays as a prince. Syed Omar came from the well-respected 
Arab family who were descendants of Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was a nephew of Syed Mohammed bin Harun Al Junied, who also came 
from Palembang to Singapore in the early days before the founding of Singapore in 1819.

Syed Omar was a philanthropist and his charitable acts included donating a large plot of land in 
Victoria Street for the purposes of a Muslim burial ground, the construction of a mosque in Bencoolen Street and Masjid Kampong Melaka, 
renamed Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka in his honour. 
The land where St Andrew's Cathedral stands was also donated by him. 
He and his family contributed largely to the setting up of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. 
Syed Omar's descendants continue to reside in Singapore.[1]

In 1927, one of his descendants, Syed Abdul Rahman Aljunied, built the Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah on a vacant ground next to the Victoria Road 
cemetery in commemoration of his grandfather, Syed Omar. Madrasah Aljunied was a leading Islamic religious school which produced 
many religious leaders of Southeast Asian countries.

Lipo Factory Building is located in District D14.

04-06 1981 The Kallang–Paya Lebar Expressway (Abbreviation: KPE) is the third newest of Singapore's network of expressways. The southern section of the expressway opened first, on 26 October 2007,with the remaining section fully opened on 20 September 2008.

Connecting the East Coast Parkway in the South and the Tampines Expressway in the north-east, the 6 lane (2x3) expressway extends twelve kilometres, with approximately 8.5 kilometres (5.3 mi) of main cut and cover underground tunnels running some 10 kilometres underground when fully completed. Built at a cost of approximately S$1.8 billion (USD$1 billion), it is the longest subterranean road tunnel in Southeast Asia. The KPE is also believed to be the world's sixth longest underground road project at its time under construction. In all, the dual-carriageway expressway with three lanes in each direction will have eight interchanges, eleven on-ramps, and twelve off-ramps. The south end of the KPE also connects directly to the Marina Coastal Expressway which opened in 2013.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has awarded a contract for the expansion of the KPE/TPE interchange at the north end of the expressway and construction of a new road connection to Punggol Central, providing a new and more direct link to and from the KPE and TPE, and alleviating the traffic congestion of the TPE between the current KPE ramps and Punggol ramps. The work would involves the design and construction of roads, three new vehicular bridges crossing Sungei Serangoon and Sungei Blukar, a new flyover across TPE and other associated ramps. Construction works commenced in second quarter of 2015 and is scheduled for completion by third quarter of 2019.[6]

                                    Property Highlights :
Located within Lorong 23 Geylang, this property is one of those rare investment opportunities. The property enjoys close proximity to the city, and as it is limited in supply of such properties being offered in central location, there is greater scope for enhanced capital appreciation over the longer term.
. 
The property has excellent connectivity via an established network of major roads and expressways. Its close proximity to the Aljunied MRT station along the East-West line also makes it one of the most convenient and accessible of industrial properties - an attribute that even some investment grade offices do not have. 

The subject property is located on the “Upper floor” of an 10-storey modern industrial building with ample  parking within the first floor. The building’s efficient floor plate design and rectangular configuration with 6 units on each floor is expected to attract businesses wishing to consolidate their operations in one location. It is especially ideal for businesses faced with issues of rising rents, poor transportation links and are looking for their own premises. 

Property characteristics 
* 10-storey building 
* Located close to the city
* 5 minutes’ walk from the Aljunied MRT station 
* Zoned Business 1 
* Ample car parking 
* Efficient rectangular floor plate 
* Wide central corridor serving all units 
* 2 passenger lifts and 1 cargo lift 
* Loading and unloading cargo bays 
* 24/7 security at building entrance 
* Nearby abundant amenities and facilities 
* Good potential for subdivision into smaller strata units
