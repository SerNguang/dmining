The design, among other functions, reduces the impact of noise resulting from the road traffic and enhances the penetration of the natural light into the building. People who live in the property’s apartment find shopping to be a breeze since there are lots of shops at the lower levels of the tower. The access to education shouldn’t be a problem to the residents as the vicinity of the property has numerous learning centres like Farrer Park Primary School, Jewellery Design & Management International School, Insworld Institute, Stamford Primary School, and Bendemeer Primary School.
