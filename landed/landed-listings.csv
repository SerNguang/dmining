Toh Crescent | Freehold | District 17 | Cluster Semi-Detached 

MCST: $250/month
—
A unique residence for cluster house lovers, this 5 bedroom, 5 bathroom, 2-Storey Semi-Detached with a Basement and Attic blends a practical, family-friendly layout with a host of durable, high-end finishes. 
—
Features of this house include a matrix of different materials that make up each units’ façade, each with a role to play in terms of function and aesthetics: grey granite walls define the first storey walls; the timber of the junior master bedroom’s bries soleil-layered window fronting the pool screen views and shade while merging with the surrounding tropicality; the aluminium for the staircase curtain wall screen with a geometric pattern lends a sense of movement and play to the elevations and also a sense of modernity.

Situated within a landed property zone in the east of Singapore, this development offers the compactness of a 2,000 SQM plot while addressing the issues of privacy so often overlooked but so paramount in dense living.

Situated within a landed property zone in the east of Singapore, this development offers the compactness of a 2,000 SQM plot while addressing the issues of privacy so often overlooked but so paramount in dense living.
Thoughtfully designed by HYLA Architects, the original sloping profile of the land was kept, and the entire first storey was raised to allow for a basement car park.

Lichi Avenue is very close to the new Bidadari Estate.  

About Bidadari Estate.
There will be a 10 hectare park in Bidadari Estate. THis park will feature a lake, open lawns, a 700 metre heritage walk and six kilometres of wooded experiential trails for nature lovers to observe flora and fauna. There will be a greenway which will extend out from the park and connect to other public spaces within Bidadari. There will also be a play area with a 5 meter treehouse to encourage exploration and play.  This park is a multi-agency collaboration between HDB, national water agency PUB and the National Heritage Board (NHB).

How big is the park? It will be twice the size of Toa Payoh Town Park and take up more than a tenth of the 93 ha land in the estate.

The Bidadari estate will also feature Singapore’s first underground service reservoir. This reservoir stores drinking water to regulate supply to homes and boost water pressure during periods of high demand. The service reservoir tank will be built beneath the community lawn in Bidadari Park to optimise land use, creating more green spaces for residents to enjoy.

Featured on Straits Times, a pair of Bungalows in Sentosa Cove
                                    Imagine being able to live in a home that’s modeled like an ultra-luxurious super yacht, without having to put in the maintenance required of a sailing vessel. That was what the developer of this sleek three-storey home requested from Italian firm Mercurio Design Lab when they engaged the studio to develop the site. 

The design lab proposed the building of two homes, each shaped like the hull of a modern super yacht. 

One of the most outstanding features of the house is the slanted wall at the back of the home. The curved edges running along the walls accord the structure with a sophisticated Italian flair. 

On Sentosa Island, the award-winning 18-hole Sentosa Golf Club, multi-billion integrated Resorts World Sentosa with Universal Studios and many other entertainment options are within easy reach. Minutes away is the Habourfront MRT Station, Singapore Cruise Centre, VivoCity Shopping Mall and the Central Business District.

As Featured on Straits Times!! Sentosa Cove $39M Bungalow
                                    Imagine being able to live in a home that’s modeled like an ultra-luxurious super yacht, without having to put in the maintenance required of a sailing vessel. That was what the developer of this sleek three-storey home requested from Italian firm Mercurio Design Lab when they engaged the studio to develop the site. 

The design lab proposed the building of two homes, each shaped like the hull of a modern super yacht. 

One of the most outstanding features of the house is the slanted wall at the back of the home. The curved edges running along the walls accord the structure with a sophisticated Italian flair. 

On Sentosa Island, the award-winning 18-hole Sentosa Golf Club, multi-billion integrated Resorts World Sentosa with Universal Studios and many other entertainment options are within easy reach. Minutes away is the Habourfront MRT Station, Singapore Cruise Centre, VivoCity Shopping Mall and the Central Business District.

Contact us for an exclusive viewing for this piece of art in sentosa cove island today.

Nestled in Sentosa, the most exclusive marina residential, Alba which means ‘sunset’ in Italian are twin villas. It calls to mind the image of a round sun as yellow as an organic yolk, sinking behind the deep blue sea, disappearing from the horizon to signal that man, at this hour, must begin to wind down rest. In the same manner, Villa Alba suggests exactly that. Standing in front of the open sea, it has a semi-circular form, red terracotta roof and warm travertine cladding that, when united, compel one to breathe. The sunset, which gives way to the night, symbolizes an ending that leads to a new beginning. Similarly, this villa signals a start: having been designed at a time where few houses in Sentosa Cove showcased excellent architectural design, Villa Alba began a new era of design on this side of the world.
The sites of these twin villas are of rectangular shape and are heavily constrained by setbacks and regulations. In particular, a rule required by Singapore Cove Private Limited, is that the attic floor is built only within a maximum angle of 30 degrees of roof line that originates on the spring line, thereby greatly limiting the expression in the design of the building that for the sake of maximizing its allowable area from market demand, the extra space on the roof top is needed.
This geometrical resolution of a statutory problem inspired the beauty of making a house that resembles the sun rising on

Two storey detached house with in ground pool
                                    The Australia-based owners approached a renowned Australian architect to develop a small block of land on District 11, an affluent area in Singapore. Completed in 2009, the double-storey residential home was designed for longevity and aesthetics. Passive sustainable designs have been incorporated, including large windows that take advantage of the lush green surroundings that also allow natural daylight exposure to all interior spaces. Climatically responsive design enables natural cooling and sufficient shading in the hot tropical context.

Spatial demands were tight for a highly valued piece of land. Apart from 4 bedrooms and a swimming pool, the clients needed flexible spaces for living and entertaining. Familiarisation with local authorities and building regulations required some effort. Part of it was to meet a requirement for all new houses to have a bomb shelter. After the boundary setbacks, the house size had to be maximised and spaces carefully arranged to utilise scarce spaces.

Upside potential with Jurong Innovation District, Jurong Regional Line
                                    Exclusive semi-detached for sale

Westville @ Westwood Walk
2153 sqft of a regular rectangular land
Approximately 3300sqft of built-up

Why is this a bargain?
It is because the cost of owning this property is almost the same as owning a four-bedroom condominium in the same area, but you have so much more. You have 5 ensuite bedrooms, a back yard for laundry or wet kitchen, a private car porch and a garden for leisure. We must not forget about the high ceiling, large bedrooms and no maintenance fees.

Why is there an upside potential?
The answer is the Jurong Innovation District. The new hub for advanced manufacturing in Jurong West is welcoming six new entrants over the next three years, ranging from industry giants to research institutions, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (22nd Oct 2019 / Straits Times).

They are German conglomerate Siemens; American multinational Flowserve; German engineering firm Bosch Rexroth; Singapore-listed motion control systems specialist ISDN; the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology; as well as the National Metrology Centre.

The first phase of the 600-hectare JID is expected to be completed around 2022, with the district creating over 95,000 new jobs.

Jurong Regional Line
Stage 1, 2026: Connecting Choa Chu Kang to Boon Lay and Tawas via JRL (West)
Stations: 10
Interchanges: Choa Chu Kang (NSL), Boon Lay (EWL), Bukit Panjang LRT

Ideal attributes of the house;

Carmen Street 
Named after the Opera Carmen 

Carmen [kaʁ.mɛn] is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed by the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences.

The fact that it is so close to the MRT – it is a 8 minute walk from Beauty world MRT Station – it is a huge plus point for this development and will be the reason most people buy. It is also situated quite near to several other Bus Stops such as Bef Jln Jurong Kechil, Aft Chun Tin Rd, Blk 18, and many more which are only 2 minutes away which gives access to the residents to many different areas of Singapore. Due to availability of too many amenities on the doorstep, it is an ideal place to live and there will be many other changes as gentrification tales hold of the area in the future, and the impact is lessened to a large extent by the MRT.

Ultra Luxury Good Class Bungalow 超豪华高档别墅 !  English | Chinese Version (中文版) 

Most exquisite villa sitting on the most expensive and prime locale in Tanglin. Looking for the most memorable home that encompasses beauty, culture and tradition yet modern, this luxury villa with sprawling land and space for parking is rarely available especially in Singapore. Total privacy, comfort and elegance and just 5 minutes away from the most Priviledged Location in the heart of Orchard Road.

Tanglin is a quiet but sophisticated neighborhood. Characterised by some seriously grand houses, foreign embassies, and stunning greenery, the area has an aura of elegance and exclusivity.

Living in one of Singapore’s most affluent neighborhoods means safety and security are higher than anywhere else on the island (and that’s saying something!). The area offers a lot of greenery so enjoy your morning yoga practice in the Botanic Gardens, before heading to Dempsey Hill for a refuel and a potter around the shops

最精致的别墅坐落在 Tanglin (东陵) 最昂贵和黄金地段。 这座豪华别墅拥有广阔的土 地和可供停车的空间，这套豪华的别墅正在寻找一个既包含美感，文化和传统又具有 现代气息的最令人难忘的房屋，尤其是在新加坡，这种情况很少见。 完全的隐私，舒 适和优雅，距离乌节路中心最优越的地理位置仅 5 分钟路程。

Tanglin (东陵) 是一个安静而精致的社区。 该地区以一些严肃的豪宅，外国使馆和令 人惊叹的绿化为特征，具有优雅和排他性的氛围。

生活在新加坡最富裕的社区之一，意味着安全和保障比岛上其他任何地方都要高(这 就是话!)。 该地区提供许多绿化，所以在植物园享受早晨瑜伽练习之后，再前往登 普西(Dempsey Hill)在商店周围加油和陶艺。

Luxury East Coast Road Semi Detached House
                                    A modern, classical and quintessential semi detached house with highly coveted sprawling grounds, a long driveway, and an enviable front porch with space to park more than 5 cars. 

Located in the heart of Frankel estate, within walking distance to Siglap V, Siglap Centre, enjoying unparalleled convenience to all amenities and public transportation. 

Live in the lap of luxury; don't compromise on the measly cramped conditions of some of the semi detached that hardly gives you the room to maneuver comfortably. Choose to enjoy the real lifestyle of landed house living, choose large grounds, choose ample parking space for your cars and your guests' cars. 

Choose to rent this house. Definitely the most comfortable space for your family and for yourself. Now is the time! Call Stephanie at 97834516

                                    Imagine being able to live in a home that’s modeled like an ultra-luxurious super yacht, without having to put in the maintenance required of a sailing vessel. That was what the developer of this sleek three-storey home requested from Italian firm Mercurio Design Lab when they engaged the studio to develop the site. 

The design lab proposed the building of two homes, each shaped like the hull of a modern super yacht. 

One of the most outstanding features of the house is the slanted wall at the back of the home. The curved edges running along the walls accord the structure with a sophisticated Italian flair. 

On Sentosa Island, the award-winning 18-hole Sentosa Golf Club, multi-billion integrated Resorts World Sentosa with Universal Studios and many other entertainment options are within easy reach. Minutes away is the Habourfront MRT Station, Singapore Cruise Centre, VivoCity Shopping Mall and the Central Business District.
